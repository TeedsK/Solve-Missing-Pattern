# Solve-Missing-Pattern
This is my first repository so this is a pretty simple function. This code takes in a linear pattern with a minimum of 3 arguments. The function will then return the missing number in the linear pattern. Example, for a pattern of +2 every time, you could input 2,4,8 and the function will return 6.
